<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>ManTools</cite> are a set of Perl scripts intended for generating StrongHelp, HTML, DDF and plain text help files from a single source file.  The intention is to make it easier to supply a both plain text and formatted versions of software manuals.  The markup options available have a strong bias towards creating documentation for ROSC&nbsp;OS software.

To use the scripts natively on RISC&nbsp;OS, a copy of Perl&nbsp;5 will be required. At the time of writing, a copy can be found at <link ref="#url http://www.cp15.org/perl/">http://www.cp15.org/perl/</link>. The scripts are command-line based, and should be installed in a library or called by their full pathname.

</chapter>





<chapter title="Command Line Use" file="Use">

The scripts that comprise <cite>ManTools</cite> are <cite>TextMan</cite>, <cite>StrongMan</cite>, <cite>HTMLMan</cite> and <cite>DDFMan</cite>. Each script takes the same parameters on the command line, and in their simplest form should be called with the syntax:

<command>textman &lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;</command>

This two-parameter format is provided for backwards compatibility. If constants are required to be defined by the called (such as in a Makefile, then then an alternative syntax is provided:

<command>textman -I&lt;infile&gt; -O&lt;outfile&gt; -D&lt;constant&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</command>

This allows constants to be defined externally from the script (maybe for things such as creation date or build version). If multiple constants are required, more than one <code>-D</code> parameter can be supplied to the script.


<subhead title="Output types">

<cite>ManTools</cite> manuals are formed from a sequence of blocks and chapters: how these are used by a script depends upon its output format. The text, HTML and DDF scripts generate a single file in the target format which contains all of the applicable blocks in sequence. The StrongHelp script creates a folder with the name of the output file, and saves each part of the source into a separate file within it; a separate tool (such as BindHelp or StrongHelp itself) will be required to turn these files into a finished manual.

How individual output formats handle aspects of the markup will depend on their capabilities. Individual scripts are free to ignore tags and entities which they can not process sensibly: for example, while <code>&lt;file&gt;...&lt;/file&gt;</code> might create italic text in an HTML document, it will have no visible effect in a text manual.

</chapter>





<chapter title="Markup language" file="Markup">

The markup tags used by <cite>ManTools</cite> are similar to HTML, but the whole structure is simplified and with a less rigorous structure.  All tags are enclosed in angle brackets (like &lt;this&gt;) and reserved characters are inserted using the standard entities starting with ampersand. Rrecognised entities are:

<list>
<li>&amp;lt; - &lt;
<li>&amp;gt; - &gt;
<li>&amp;amp; - &amp;
<li>&amp;quot; - &quot;
<li>&amp;nbsp; - non-breaking space
</list>

Unlike in HTML, paragraphs are not enclosed in <code>&lt;p&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt;</code> tags.  Instead, each paragraph must be on one line in the file, with one or more newlines at the end. Using a text editor that supports soft-wrap (ie. not <cite>Edit</cite>) will help to make this easier.

Two types of tag are defined: inline tags and block tags.  Inline tags appear within the text of a paragraph &lt;em&gt;like this&lt;/em&gt; and apply formatting to all or part of that line. They can not span across more than one paragraph.  Block tags, on the other hand, appear on lines of their own

<codeblock>
&lt;codeblock&gt;
like this
&lt;/codeblock&gt;
</codeblock>

and provide structure to the document. Their contents can include one or more paragraphs, as required; they may also affect the formatting of the output.


<subhead title="General document structure">

A <cite>ManTools</cite> document starts with block tags defining details of the document itself and setting constants to be used elsewhere. Following on from these, the source contains a sequence of chapters and literal blocks. Chapters are written out to all outputs, laid out appropriately to take into account the capabilities of the target format. Literal blocks are written out unchanged, if the target format matches that to which the block is attached.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Document Structure" file="Structure">

A source file consists of one or more sections or chapters, which are put together to form a complete manual. How these are interpreted will depend on the format being produced: some conversions (such as plain text) concatenate all of the sections into a single file, while others (such as StrongHelp) put each section into its own file.

Every source file must start with the &lt;document&nbsp;...&gt; tag, which gives details of the manual being created.

<definition target="&lt;document&nbsp;...&gt;">
The <code>&lt;document ...&gt;</code> tag appears at the top of a document, at the block level. It supplies details about that document, and is not closed.

The defined attributes are:

<list>
<li><code>title</code>: the title of the document.  Used to prefix chapter titles in <cite>StrongHelp</cite> title-bars.
</list>
</definition>

The &lt;document&nbsp;...&gt; tag is followed by any variable definitions which are required by the rest of the manual.

<definition target="&lt;define&nbsp;...&gt;">
The <code>&lt;define ...&gt;</code> tag appears at the top of a document, at the block level; it is not closed. Each tag defines a single constant which can be used later on in literal blocks document.

The defined attributes are:

<list>
<li><code>name</code>: the name of the constant.
<li><code>value</code>: the value to be given to the constant.
<li><code>length</code>: the length of the constant's field, in characters.
<li><code>align</code>: the alignment of the constant's contents in the field.
</list>

The <code>length</code> and <code>align</code> attributes are optional, and will be ignored if they do not make sense in the context of a specific output format.
</definition>

Following on from the document and constant definitions are a series of blocks of content which form the help text. Literal blocks are passed straight to the output for their specific format (and ignored for all other formats); chapters go into all outputs, but are formatted according to the requirements of the specific output before they go.

<definition target="&lt;literal ...&gt; ... &lt;/literal&gt;">
The <code>&lt;literal ...&gt; ... &lt;/literal&gt;</code> tag pair enclose a block of text that will be written to a specific type of output file.  The block is written with no translation apart from the insertion of variables.

The defined attributes are:

<list>
<li><code>mode</code>: the output mode that will output the text.
<li><code>file</code>: the file name if multiple output files are produced.
</list>
</definition>

The following output modes are currently defined, and are case-insensitive:

<list>
<li>Text
<li>Strong
<li>HTML
<li>DDF
</list>

<definition target="&lt;chapter ...&gt; ... &lt;/chapter&gt;">
The <code>&lt;chapter ...&gt; ... &lt;/chapter&gt;</code> tag pair enclose a block of text that forms a chapter in a document.  Depending upon the type of manual being produced, this will either form a section of text with a main heading above it, or it will be a separate page.

The defined attributes are:

<list>
<li><code>title</code>: the title of the chapter as used in the document.
<li><code>file</code>: the file name or link attribute.  This is used to reference the chapter in the <code>&lt;link ...&gt;</code> tag and will be used as a filename if multiple output files are produced.
</list>
</definition>




<subhead title="Block tags">

Block tags must appear on a line of their own.  Some of them have a closing tag, although this is not universal.  Those that are closed apply to one or more whole paragraphs that are located between the tags.






<definition target="&lt;subhead ...&gt;">
The <code>&lt;subhead ...&gt;</code> tag appears in a chapter and inserts a sub heading at that point.  It is not closed.

The defined attributes are:

<list>
<li><code>title</code>: the title of the subsection.
</list>
</definition>


<definition target="&lt;list&gt; ... &lt;/list&gt;">
The <code>&lt;list ...&gt; ... &lt;/list&gt;</code> tag pair enclose a bullet-point list.  The paragraphs between the tags are indented as a list and those with <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> at the start are given a bullet point.

The defined attributes are:

<list>
<li><code>type</code>: the type of list.  This can be <code>bullet</code>, <code>num</code>, <code>upper</code> or <code>lower</code>.  The default is bullet.

<li><code>spacing</code>: the line spacing.  This is either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>; the default is 0.
</list>
</definition>


<definition target="&lt;codeblock&gt; ... &lt;/codeblock&gt;">
The <code>&lt;codeblock ...&gt; ... &lt;/codeblock&gt;</code> tag pair enclose a section of code or literal text.  All lines (including blank ones) are output to the file.  A monospace font and indentation are used if applicable.

The are no defined attributes.
</definition>


<definition target="&lt;box&gt; ... &lt;/box&gt;">
The <code>&lt;box ...&gt; ... &lt;/box&gt;</code> tag pair enclose a section of text that is to be highligted or stand out from the remaining copy (such as a 'box' in a magazine).

The are no defined attributes.
</definition>


<definition target="&lt;definition ...&gt; ... &lt;/definition&gt;">
The <code>&lt;definition ...&gt; ... &lt;/definition&gt;</code> tag pair enclose a definition of a piece of text (the target).  This is equivalent to the <code>&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;</code> structure in HTML.

The defined attributes are:

<list>
<li><code>target</code>: the text being defined by the content of the definition block.
</list>
</definition>


<subhead title="In-line tags">

Unlike block tags, inline tags appear within a line of text.  The apply formatting to individual words or characters, as opposed to entire paragraphs.

<definition target="&lt;link ...&gt; ... &lt;/link&gt;">
The <code>&lt;link ...&gt; ... &lt;/link&gt;</code> tag pair enclose a hyperlink, that will be used in output formats that support these.

The defined attributes are:

<list>
<li><code>ref</code>: the <code>file</code> attribute from a <code>&lt;chapter ...&gt;</code> tag pair elsewhere in the document, defining the location to jump to. Alternatively, the reference can start with a <cite>StrongHelp</cite> format <code>#url </code> (with a trailing space) to indicate that what follows is a URI.
</list>
</definition>

<definition target="Semantic tags">
There are several semantic tags that can be used to apply meaning to pieces of text.  These are:

<list>
<li><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>: indicates a citation.

<li><code>&lt;code&gt;</code>: identifies an inline block of code.

<li><code>&lt;em&gt;</code>: emphasises the text.

<li><code>&lt;file&gt;</code>: shows a file name or path.

<li><code>&lt;icon&gt;</code>: indicates an icon (button) label.

<li><code>&lt;key&gt;</code>: indicates a key name.

<li><code>&lt;menu&gt;</code>: marks a menu entry.

<li><code>&lt;mouse&gt;</code>: indicates a mouse button.

<li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>: strongly emphasises the text.

<li><code>&lt;window&gt;</code>: marks a window title.
</list>
</definition>
